            <h1>MY APPROACH TOWARDS PHOTOGRAPHYâ€¦</h1>
            <h4>I primarily focus on capturing sincere moments in my work - catching candid, authentic scenes and
                expressions. I am not keen on heavy post production, I prefer a subtle approach that ever so slightly
                enhances the reality.
                <h4>Looking back at my photographs, I see a trend: shots taken spontaneously, or by surprise are usually
                    the most beautiful ones.</h4>
                <h4>Relationship with nature is very important to me and this is translated into my work - it gives me a
                    lot of satisfaction when I can take photographs of people immersed in the beauty of nature. </h4>
                <h4>What I love most about photography is that it opens our eyes to things that usually go unnoticed and
                    it creates memories of those most special times of our lives.</h4>

                <h3>Hi, I'm Ewelina!</h3>
                <p>I am a Polish born, London based photographer. Obsessed with the golden hour- chances are if there is
                    an amazing sunset on the horizon, I am standing with my camera taking photos of it! </p>
                <p>I love photography in all its aspects. I am most excited shooting portraits, nature and architecture.
                    I have worked on numerous projects including personal branding, fashion, art, real estate and
                    interior design. </p>
                <p>My clients consists of couples, families, small business owners, artists, painters, musicians, and so
                    on. </p>
                <p>I try to spend as much time outdoors as possible, I love travelling and exploring new places, I never
                    forget to take my camera with me - I need to be covered in case I notice something worth capturing
                    :)</p>
                <p></p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-me-column2">
                <p>When the weather is less kind, I love spending time cuddling with my other half watching movies & our
                    favourite tv series. </p>
                <p>In case you are wondering how my adventure with photography started.</p>
                <p>I have always loved taking photographs & having my photos taken too, but back in 2016 I went on a
                    trip to Iceland with a specific goal of seeing the Northern Lights.</p>
                <p>This is when I had to learn all about the manual shooting mode (if you do not know how to operate it,
                    you CANNOT capture the light festival on the night sky!). I immediately fell in love with the
                    process - the technical aspects combined with creative flair were pretty challenging but equally
                    satisfying!</p>
